# **Person Class with Real-Time Age Calculation (Python + datetime)**

Educational and practical example of **Object-Oriented Programming** that creates a `Person` class capable of storing personal data and automatically calculating the **current age** using the system date.

### **What this code does exactly**

* Defines a `Person` class with the attributes:

  * First name, last name, ID number, birth year, country, and gender
* Uses the `datetime` library to automatically get the **current year**
* Includes two useful methods:

  * `.printInfo()` → displays all the person’s information in a clean, readable format
  * `.calculateAge()` → subtracts the current year from the birth year and returns the actual age
* Creates an example object and prints its data + age on screen
